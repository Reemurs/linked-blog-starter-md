When you are troubled, lift up your hands to the sanctuary:
> 'Lift up your hands to the sanctuary And bless the Lord.' (Psalm 134:2)
Ex. On a turbulent boat in storm and lift up hands towards the lightning and the rain because you know your sanctuary is there.

**Why Should I be grateful towards God?**
> 'Bless the Lord , my soul, And all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, my soul, And do not forget any of His benefits; Who pardons all your guilt, Who heals all your diseases; Who redeems your life from the pit, Who crowns you with favor and compassion; Who satisfies your years with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.' (Psalm 103:1-5)

He holds no wrath towards us. We are forgiven:
> 'The Lord is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in mercy. He will not always contend with us, Nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our guilty deeds. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, So great is His mercy toward those who fear Him. As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our wrongdoings from us. Just as a father has compassion on his children, So the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.' (Psalm 103:8-13)

We are nothing in comparison to God:
> 'For He Himself knows our form; He is mindful that we are nothing but dust. ¶As for man, his days are like grass; Like a flower of the field, so he flourishes. When the wind has passed over it, it is no more, And its place no longer knows about it.' (Psalm 103:14-16)
- Anti-pride; comfort that we can rely on God's strength; our greatest earthly treasures/pleasures/idols are ephemeral, so do not give up your soul (disobey) to gain the whole world
>'Many, Lord my God, are the wonders which You have done, And Your thoughts toward us; There is no one to compare with You. If I would declare and speak of them, They would be too numerous to count.' (Psalm 40:5)
>
>'Arise, Lord, do not let mankind prevail; Let the nations be judged before You. ¶The wicked will return to Sheol, All the nations who forget God.' (Psalm 9:17,19)

Connection b/w obedience, blessing & mercy:
> 'But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting for those who fear Him, And His justice to the children’s children, To those who keep His covenant And remember His precepts, so as to do them. ¶The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, And His sovereignty rules over all. Bless the Lord , you His angels, Mighty in strength, who perform His word, Obeying the voice of His word! Bless the Lord, all you His angels, You who serve Him, doing His will. Bless the Lord, all you works of His, In all places of His dominion; Bless the Lord, my soul!' (Psalm 103:17-22)
>  
>'¶How blessed is the man who has made the Lord his trust, And has not turned to the proud, nor to those who become involved in falsehood.' (Psalm 40:4)

Do not be overwhelmed by your problems. Wait patiently for God's promised deliverance (and his word is always true):
> 'I waited patiently for the Lord; And He reached down to me and heard my cry. He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the mud; And He set my feet on a rock, making my footsteps firm.' (Psalm 40:1-2)

Ppl see you praising God & his deliverance/providence for you & they may be converted:
> 'He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear And will trust in the Lord.' (Psalm 40:3)

God will always care for you & protect you even when you are marred by guilt:
>'I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your mercy and Your truth from the great congregation. ¶I have proclaimed good news of righteousness in the great congregation; Behold, I will not restrain my lips, Lord, You know. ==“I delight to do Your will, my God; Your Law is within my heart.”== ¶You, Lord, will not withhold Your compassion from me; Your mercy and Your truth will continually watch over me. For evils beyond number have surrounded me; My guilty deeds have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see; They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, And my heart has failed me. May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; May those who love Your salvation continually say, “The Lord be exalted!” But I am afflicted and needy; May the Lord be mindful of me. You are my help and my savior; Do not delay, my God. ¶Be pleased, L ord , to rescue me; Hurry, L ord , to help me.' (Psalm 40:8-13,16-17)
- Highlighted: Let this be your mindset
- Do not hold yourself back with shame, for God is not ashamed of you. His name is worthy of being praised and proclaimed unabashedly from the rooftops
>'I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart; I will tell of all Your wonders. I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.' (Psalm 9:1-2)
>
>'The Lord will also be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble; And those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, Lord, have not abandoned those who seek You.' (Psalm 9:9-10)
>
>'For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.' (Psalm 9:18)

Do not fear, Lord will protect you from evil forces, as they have no power other tahn what he allocates for them:
>'¶When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You. You have rebuked the nations, You have eliminated the wicked; You have wiped out their name forever and ever.' (Psalm 9:3,5)

God is just. There is no reason to disagree with his judgement. You are not more just than God:
>'For You have maintained my just cause; You have sat on the throne judging righteously.' (Psalm 9:4)

Wisdom #1
>'The Lord has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. A wicked one is ensnared in the work of his own hands. *Higgaion Selah*' (Psalm 9:16)
