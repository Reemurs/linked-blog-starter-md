When you are troubled, lift up your hands to the sanctuary:
> 'Lift up your hands to the sanctuary And bless the Lord.' (Psalm 134:2)
Ex. On a turbulent boat in storm and lift up hands towards the lightning and the rain because you know your sanctuary is there.

**Why Should I be grateful towards God?**
> 'Bless the Lord , my soul, And all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, my soul, And do not forget any of His benefits; Who pardons all your guilt, Who heals all your diseases; Who redeems your life from the pit, Who crowns you with favor and compassion; Who satisfies your years with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle.' (Psalm 103:1-5)

He holds no wrath towards us. We are forgiven:
> 'The Lord is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in mercy. He will not always contend with us, Nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our guilty deeds. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, So great is His mercy toward those who fear Him. As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our wrongdoings from us. Just as a father has compassion on his children, So the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.' (Psalm 103:8-13)

We are nothing in comparison to God:
> 'For He Himself knows our form; He is mindful that we are nothing but dust. ¶As for man, his days are like grass; Like a flower of the field, so he flourishes. When the wind has passed over it, it is no more, And its place no longer knows about it.' (Psalm 103:14-16)
- Anti-pride; comfort that we can rely on God's strength; our greatest earthly treasures/pleasures/idols are ephemeral, so do not give up your soul (disobey) to gain the whole world
>'Many, Lord my God, are the wonders which You have done, And Your thoughts toward us; There is no one to compare with You. If I would declare and speak of them, They would be too numerous to count.' (Psalm 40:5)
>
>'Arise, Lord, do not let mankind prevail; Let the nations be judged before You. ¶The wicked will return to Sheol, All the nations who forget God. Put them in fear, Lord; Let the nations know that they are *merely* human. Selah' (Psalm 9:17,19-20)
- One forgets God when they disregard his ways and seek to fulfill their own needs with their own plans (selfish ambition)
	- They pointlessly search for satisfaction that can only come from him
	- This is wickedness
	- They have forgotten that they are only human. That they have no right to depart from the Lord and God will show them that through his power (getting diarrhea when you were living in a pattern of disobedience & deliberately ignoring the voice of God {not helplessness, but a willful way of living})

Connection b/w obedience, blessing & mercy:
> 'But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting for those who fear Him, And His justice to the children’s children, To those who keep His covenant And remember His precepts, so as to do them. ¶The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, And His sovereignty rules over all. Bless the Lord , you His angels, Mighty in strength, who perform His word, Obeying the voice of His word! Bless the Lord, all you His angels, You who serve Him, doing His will. Bless the Lord, all you works of His, In all places of His dominion; Bless the Lord, my soul!' (Psalm 103:17-22)
>  
>'¶How blessed is the man who has made the Lord his trust, And has not turned to the proud, nor to those who become involved in falsehood.' (Psalm 40:4)

Do not be overwhelmed by your problems. Wait patiently for God's promised deliverance (and his word is always true):
> 'I waited patiently for the Lord; And He reached down to me and heard my cry. He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the mud; And He set my feet on a rock, making my footsteps firm.' (Psalm 40:1-2)

Ppl see you praising God & his deliverance/providence for you & they may be converted:
> 'He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear And will trust in the Lord.' (Psalm 40:3)

God will always care for you & protect you even when you are marred by guilt:
>'I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your mercy and Your truth from the great congregation. ¶I have proclaimed good news of righteousness in the great congregation; Behold, I will not restrain my lips, Lord, You know. ==“I delight to do Your will, my God; Your Law is within my heart.”== ¶You, Lord, will not withhold Your compassion from me; Your mercy and Your truth will continually watch over me. For evils beyond number have surrounded me; My guilty deeds have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see; They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, And my heart has failed me. May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; May those who love Your salvation continually say, “The Lord be exalted!” But I am afflicted and needy; May the Lord be mindful of me. You are my help and my savior; Do not delay, my God. ¶Be pleased, L ord , to rescue me; Hurry, L ord , to help me.' (Psalm 40:8-13,16-17)
- Highlighted: Let this be your mindset
- Do not hold yourself back with shame, for God is not ashamed of you. His name is worthy of being praised and proclaimed unabashedly from the rooftops
>'I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart; I will tell of all Your wonders. I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.' (Psalm 9:1-2)
>
>'The Lord will also be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble; And those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, Lord, have not abandoned those who seek You.' (Psalm 9:9-10)
>
>'For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.' (Psalm 9:18)

Do not fear, Lord will protect you from evil forces, as they have no power other tahn what he allocates for them:
>'¶When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You. You have rebuked the nations, You have eliminated the wicked; You have wiped out their name forever and ever.' (Psalm 9:3,5)

God is just. There is no reason to disagree with his judgement. You are not more just than God:
>'For You have maintained my just cause; You have sat on the throne judging righteously.' (Psalm 9:4)

Wisdom #1
>'The Lord has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. A wicked one is ensnared in the work of his own hands. *Higgaion Selah*' (Psalm 9:16)

The only way to overcome evil is to draw near to the Lord:
>'Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. ' (Ephesians 6:10-13)
- You are weak alone, but you are strong when you are drawn near to the Lord
- You cannot rely on the flesh alone to beat evil becuase evil is not just of the flesh, it is directed by spiritual forces (beyons your scope of knowledge/smarts/strength) & only the Lord is qualified to command the battle against them
- So, the only way to fully resist evil is by wearing the armor of God (having an open ear/heart towards him & doing what he says to do {the armor parts})
>'Stand firm therefore, having belted your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 
- do not lie
- be receptive to God's truth & do not fight it & always think about it
- Faith = righteousness; obey God & be of good character
>and having strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
- share the gospel like God has commanded you to the
- Remember the Jesus who took upon himself so much pain to save you. Remember his love so you will not so easily betray him for goodies like Judas did
>in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 
- without faith you cannot do anything else b/c you will not listen to him if you do not believe in him & what he says. You will look for your needs in other places because you do not trust God to meet them. You won't care about him b/c do not have faith that he is who he is (a loving and strong {rebuking} God)
- Remember that Satan is always throwing flames at you, so never let you guard down & do not let them overwhelm you since who are overcomers in He who overcame the world
>And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
- Know who you are, a child of God, so you will not return to the evil you were taken out of like a dog to returning to its own vomit + don't be overwhelmed by evil b/c God will take care of it
- Listen to the spirit. Do not dismiss or ignore him. He tells what you have to do in order to overcome. Any straying from him is surrendering yourself to evil forces (and letting them {those that hate you and God=everything that is good} do whatever they want w/ you is a horrifying thought).
>With every prayer and request, pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be alert with all perseverance and every request for all the saints,' (Ephesians 6:14-18)
- Pray for the ppl who help spread the gospel (19) so they can be successful in saving more souls
- Pray to be near to God. It is is strongest resource/tool because you gain & strengthen a direct link to the creator and to the power to do good (The prayer life of soren kinkegard)

Example of teaching & comforting each other:
>'I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts. Now, so that you also may know about my circumstances as to what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make everything known to you.' (Ephesians 6:21-22)

Love comes from faith; love that comes from faith will always be pure:
>'Peace be to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.' (Ephesians 6:23-24)

>'“Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.' (Matthew 7:6)
- do not give yourself & work to please unbelievers (dogs) becuase they will not reciprocate (true) affection and they will turn against (betray) you in the end because they only have the flesh as a moral compass to rely on

>'“Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.' (Matthew 7:13-14)
- The gate is broad because people are doing what is easy
- Ex. Troubleshooting is hard, but you do it anyways because starting something that God does not want is more appealing than starting something that is
- if you act solely based upon what is easy, you will be perished. Seek life.
>'“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.”' (Matthew 7:24-27)
- Be ready for when trouble comes. Survive what brings you turmoil and distress. Obey God.

>''for He was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.' (Matthew 7:29)
- Jesus is not just a bunch of written rules. He is a person who has complete authority over your life and He has the right to tell you what to do with your life.

>'What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is the source not your pleasures that wage war in your body’s parts? You lust and do not have, so you commit murder. And you are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask with the wrong motives, so that you may spend what you request on your pleasures. You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says to no purpose, “ He jealously desires the Spirit whom He has made to dwell in us”? But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, “God is opposed to the proud , but gives grace to the humble .” Submit therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come close to God and He will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be miserable, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into gloom. Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.' (James 4:1-10)
- You are drawn away by lust to be thrust into inner conflicts and quarrels
- when God does not give you what you want, it is because he knows it is not right for you and that it will harm you and your progress if you take it
- When you draw away from you do so to become a friend of the world and partake in the pleasures of the world & shape yourself into the image of the devil, the enemy of God
- Do not think that you can just ignore God and get away with it. He will always do what he says. He will get retribution/rebuke. Beware she who is tempted to replace the spirit of God's guidance with the spirit of the world.
- It will be tough. It will take sacrifices. You will have to fight against your nature. Resist the devil, the one who has overcome all current and future evil is your power. Then, you will be able to breathe easy because he knows that the rock that you clung yourself to will not let Him overtake you unless you allow it.
- he will accept you and strengthen you when you repent and come to him because you are his claim
- Do whatever you have to do to be rid of sin. It will be painful to throw what gave you "joy" away. But once you have done so, you will soon realize that whatever God can give is so much better than the trap the world offers.
- Do not give a space in your heart for fondness of sin. That is being double-minded. Sin is completely incompatle with the God within you. You cannot choose both. You have to choose one. Neutrality does not exist. Sin will overtake you and consume you once you give into a little of it. Satan never wants just a toehold. Or, you can have a pure heart towards God and have your true desire be to seek him with all your heart.
- When you give your life to God (surrender what you were unwilling to let go of, the part of yourself {less of me, more of You}, that little leaven that was nurtured {massaged} into the dough {the rest of your body is corrupted by just a small bit}), you will not only be alright: You will spiritually thrive, to the point where God will exalt you because you offered yourself as a sacrifice to be his.
- Sin is being haughty because you are telling God that he does not have the right to tell you what to do with your life, but you (a mere human) do. You are telling him that you do not trust him to give you what you need. That you need to pursue your lusts because it will fulfill you more than whatever God has to offer. That the amazing things he has planned for your life is not worth the effort (of being handheld and support every step of the way through life). That sin has more value than what he stands for, and that sin has more value than what he is.
- Humble yourself. Acknowledge that God has the right to tell you what to with your life. That what he will give you will be enough (even though you know it will be better than what you could have ever asked for with your infantile knowledge of what is good and best). That you love him more than you love sin. That you believe in him and have faith that what he will fulfill his promise that making all the difficulty of obedience is worth it and that reaching such a height is possible. That you beleive he will keep his promises so that those who endure WILL be perfected and that all their pain will go away (that option will never happen with sin, because the purpose of sin is to destroy you so you will face eternal pain, and if not eternal pain then the anguish of living an ungodly life apart from the one who created/cares for/loves you whom you need to be sustained {a branch must be part of the vine or it will shrivel up and face needless suffering})
- The suffering that God gives you will only serve to increase the heights of joy and the thrill of living with Him (the sower who weeps will reap with a shout of joy). It will endure a lifetime, but it will never come back. It may be added to you at any time, but it will grow you (gold must be refined will the fire) so you will have joy and be able to understand and therefore more deeply experience the depths of God's love and you willl have peace. You will be content with who you are and what you do (no more torment over being not good enough).

>'Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.” Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. For you are just a vapor that appears for a little while, and then vanishes away. Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.” But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil. So for one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, for him it is sin.' (James 4:13-17)
- Do not worry about what you will do with your life or lean in the future
- Just do what the Lord wills
- what he wills for your future is what is beneficial
- don't arrogantly try to control your future, submit to God and do what is right (obey him) now, don't wait to do it later

>'While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the Leper, He was reclining at the table, and a woman came with an alabaster vial of very expensive perfume of pure nard. She broke the vial and poured the perfume over His head. But there were some indignantly remarking to one another, “Why has this perfume been wasted? For this perfume could have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.” And they were scolding her. But Jesus said, “Leave her alone! Why are you bothering her? She has done a good deed for Me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me. She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial. Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the entire world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.”' (Mark 14:3-9)
- Give up what's good to find what's best
- Use (dedicate) the best of your first fruits for the Lord, not your own purposes
- The disciples wanted to use the oil for their own purposes
- You set aside many resources to be used later for your own purposes, but that is in vain b/c you don't use them later, so just do what God tells you to do w/ the and actually achieve something

>'They were delighted when they heard this, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time. Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them.' (Mark 14:10-11)
- You wait for an ideal time to do evil
- you premediate it
- Do not hide your darkness in darkness, expose it to the light and confess it so it can be cleansed
- Nothing is worth betraying the Lord by loving it more than Him

>'¶Therefore justice is far from us, And righteousness does not reach us; We hope for light, but there is darkness, For brightness, but we walk in gloom. We grope for the wall like people who are blind, We grope like those who have no eyes. We stumble at midday as in the twilight; Among those who are healthy we are like the dead. All of us growl like bears, And moan sadly like doves; We hope for justice, but there is none; For salvation, but it is far from us. For our wrongful acts have multiplied before You, And our sins have testified against us; For our wrongful acts are with us, And we know our wrongdoings: Offending and denying the L ord , And turning away from our God, Speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving and uttering lying words from the heart. Justice is turned back, And righteousness stands far away; For truth has stumbled in the street, And uprightness cannot enter. Truth is lacking, And one who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey. N ow the L ord saw, And it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice. And He saw that there was no one, And was amazed that there was not one to intercede; Then His own arm brought salvation to Him, And His righteousness upheld Him.' (Isaiah 59:9-16)
- How terrible sinning and being far from God makes you feel
- this is why God created an intercessor
- He wants us to do well & be saved, even though we resist him b/c he is merciful

>'Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the Lord , but serve the Lord with all your heart. Indeed, you must not turn aside, for then you would go after useless things which cannot benefit or save, because they are useless. For the Lord will not abandon His people on account of His great name, because the L ord has been pleased to make you a people for Himself. Only fear the Lord and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you. Furthermore, as for me, far be it from me that I would sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way. But if you still do evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”' (1 Samuel 12:20-25)
- Do not fear after you have sinned and turned back to God b/c he will not abandon you
	- Listen to his instruction, do not turn aside in anyway, and serve him with all your heart
- Do not abandon him for what is useless & be subject to his wrath again (for the unsaved, in your case it is discipline)

>'“Take care not to practice your righteousness in the sight of people, to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. “So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they will be praised by people. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your charitable giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. “And when you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they will be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. But as for you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.' (Matthew 6:1-6)
- Do not let the left hand know what the right hand does: make an effort to keep your righteousness a secret so God can reward you instead of recognition being your reward (He gives better)

>'Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. A prayer of a righteous person, when it is brought about, can accomplish much.' (James 5:16)
- Intercession is powerful: seek & do it

>'in order to take hold of the hearts of the house of Israel who have turned away from Me due to all their idols.” ’Therefore speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “==Anyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, puts in front of his face the stumbling block of his wrongdoing==, and then comes to the prophet, I the Lord will let Myself answer him in the matter in view of the multitude of his idols,' (Ezekiel 14:4-5)
- God gets us to return to him by showing us that he is more powerful in front of our idols

>'So I gave my attention to the Lord God, to seek Him by prayer and pleading, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed, and said, “Oh, Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and faithfulness for those who love Him and keep His commandments, we have sinned, we have done wrong, and acted wickedly and rebelled, even turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances. Open shame belongs to us, Lord, to our kings, our leaders, and our fathers, because we have sinned against You. To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, because we have rebelled against Him; and we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in His teachings which He set before us through His servants the prophets. Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us; yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our wrongdoing and giving attention to Your truth. So the Lord has kept the disaster in store and brought it on us; for the Lord our God is righteous with respect to all His deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice. My God, incline Your ear and hear! Open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name; for we are not presenting our pleas before You based on any merits of our own, but based on Your great compassion. Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and take action! For Your own sake, my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people are called by Your name.”' (Daniel 9:3-5,8-10,13-14,18-19)
- Daniel prayed for the people's sin as if it were his own
- Plead, fast, sackcloth ashes: humble yourself when you repent & plead w/ the Lord
- Open shame belongs to you as a sinner, but compassion and forgiveness belong to God so he saves us from it (he is so much better than us, our righteousness is a filthy rag)
	- All sin gets you is shame but you can experience God's love with obedience
	- as a sinner you are nothing, but God is the one who exalts and he is the one who saved you from your sins, so don't be prideful b/c you could not have saved yourself, you are only where/who you are right now b/c of God's goodness
- Stubborn: ignore God & & don't return to him, even when you are facing the consequences b/c you have a hard and rotten heart
	- Disaster continues to come upon you & the Lord is righteous for bringing it to you b/c his judgement is righteous and he is giving you what you deserve
	- Still, he gives you a chance to repent until the day you die. Praise the Lord.
- When you repent after sinning badly, BEG God for him to listen to you (b/c you must knock hard again and again until the door is opened unto you)
