1/2 marriages break up -> be careful on a road where 1/2 of cars crash

# Reasons for Purity
- Immorality is psychologically harmful
	- “For I know my wrongdoings, And my sin is constantly before me.” (Psalm‬ ‭51‬:‭3‬)
	- Why wait ‘til marriage? You are waiting to be free—free from the shadow of conscience and the gray void of guilt—free to give all of yourself and not a panicky fraction. Some deep instinct within you knows what a tremendous experience your first complete union with another can be and that same instinct keeps telling you not to blur it, not to waste it, not to make it small.
	- Young ppl are waiting to be free and give all of themselves without the gray ghost of guilt haunting them.
- It can ruin your relationship
	- Ammon had an illicit relationship with Tamar & the Bible says that after that relationship (before it said that he loved her) that he hated her
	- There is a basic loss of respect
	- The more promiscuousness prevails the more women are looked upon as things to be used & tenderness & free love disappear
	- Girls need to understand that Immorality ≠ love
		- Boy tells a girl many times that he loves her & she says it back, but then he tells her to prove her love by sacrificing her purity upon the alter of his lust.
		- When he says I love you, he says I love me
		- What he calls love is lust
		- He loves her just as a man loves an orange when he picks it off of a tree, takes out his pocket knife and cuts a hole in the top of it, squeezes the juice of it, throws it on the ground like a piece of garbage, and wipes his mouth and says, “Man, I just love oranges.”
		- As he squeezed the purity and the sweetness and the life away, he says “Ha, I really love you.”
	- If it is “free love,” it is not love. Love involves commitment
- immorality endanger future happiness 
	- When young ppl commit immorality they put their marriage into a situation where their sensitivity is gone. It can never have the depth and beauty that it could have.
	- The highest degree of marital happiness were found in couples where both were pure before the marriage alter
	- immorality creates suspicion 
		- Ex. Man tells lady, I cannot wait until we’re married to have the satisfaction I want. He goes out to war & she says I know him, I know what he’s doing and I know what he did with me
	- Sex is so bad outside of marriage b/c it is so wonderful inside of marriage
	- You eat ur cake now & u have a crumb to eat tomorrow 
	- God wants u to have the full expression of marriage and joy as he has ordained it in his word & when u commit immortality u ruin that chance.
- ==immorality fails to bring happiness== 
	- You think it will but it never does in the wrong context
	- It can make u feel like u have no identity
	- ==God makes God’s laws for your happiness.== 
		- ==Obey them & ur happy== 
		- ==Refuse them & when u seek happiness u will end up with a mouthful of ashes==
- Immorality is not a sign of intelligence
	- The more educated someone is the less likely they are to do it
	- It is the anxious & insecure who dabble in premarital sex
	- Anytime I want to become like a loose girl, I can, but she can never again become like I am
- It is the enemy of society
	- Ex. Greece, Rome, Babylon
	- It is the enemy of the home (monogamy = glue that holds society together), then it is the enemy of society 
- Ppl who treat sex lightly will treat human beings lightly
- Danger of conception & disease
- God says thou shall not commit adultery
	- Whoremongers shall not inherit the kingdom of God
	- Marriage is honorable in the bed undefined, but adulterers and whoremongerers God will judge

# How to be pure
- ==Be careful w/ the ppl u keep company w/==
	- ==“Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”” (1 Corinthians‬ ‭15‬:‭33‬)==
	- ==Spend time w/ the wrong ppl & ur character is going to show it==
	- ==“My son, pay attention to my wisdom, Incline your ear to my understanding, So that you may maintain discretion And your lips may comply with knowledge. For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, And her speech is smoother than oil; But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death, Her steps take hold of Sheol. She does not ponder the path of life; Her ways are unstable, she does not know it. ¶Now then, my sons, listen to me And do not turn away from the words of my mouth. Keep your way far from her, And do not go near the door of her house,” (Proverbs‬ ‭5‬:‭1‬-‭8‬)==
	- ==Show me ur company & I can tell u the kind of person u are or who u are to become==
- ==Be very careful with what you look at and what you read==
	- ==if you think you can read all those girly magazines & x-rated movies & think it will not affect you, something’s wrong with you==
	- ==The world says that pornography will do you no harm==
	- ==Bible says: can a man take a fire in his bossom & be not burned==
	- ==Jesus said whosoever looks at a woman & lusts at her has committed adultery already in his heart==
	- ==Bible says: We are to set no impure things before our eyes. Whatsoever things are pure and lovely and just, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things==
	- ==You cannot put garbage in ur mind & expect to have good mental health==
	- ==You wouldn’t eat out of a garbage can & put it in ur body, you ought not to put it in ur mind==
- ==Learn to be a coward==
	- ==“Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.” (2 Timothy‬ ‭2‬:‭22‬)==
	- ==I’ll fight it, no, God says run==
	- ==“Flee sexual immorality. Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.” (1 Corinthians‬ ‭6‬:‭18)==
	- ==27 times in New Testament we are told to run==
	- ==When you deliberately place yourself into temptation, you’ve sinned already==
		- ==When couple goes to see an x-rated movie & the girl says, “Now Lord, keep us safe” who are you kidding? She already sinned when she went there.==
	- ==He who would not fall down ought not to walk in slippery places==
	- ==You don’t see how close you can get without sinning, you see how far you can stay away==
- ==Pwr of positive thinking==
	- ==You can’t think 2 things at once -> if you’re thinking of something right, you cannot think of something wrong==
	- ==Bible says: Be not overcome w/ evil, but overcome evil w/ good==
	- ==“Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, think about these things.” (Philippians‬ ‭4‬:‭8)==

Meet many ppl of the opposite sex, don’t commit early on (isolation that retards maturity) b/c one person could be a good fit for you, but someone else could be a great fit for you

Seek ur social activity in the places you would expect to find the person you want to marry
