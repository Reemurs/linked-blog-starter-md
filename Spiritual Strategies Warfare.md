# The Trinity
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (Ephesians 6:12)

Natural Kingdom = kingdom of world

That which u can experience w/ ur senses

  

But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. (I Corinthians 2:14)

U must be of a spiritual mindset to have spiritual discernment and turn away from sin/temptation

  

Spiritual warfare is "multidimensional,” which means it is fought in different dimensions. It is...

1. A social battle between the believer and the world: John 15:18-27

2. A personal battle between the flesh and the spirit: Galatians 5:16-26

3. A supernatural battle between believers and evil spiritual powers: Ephesians 6:10-27

  

The thief (Satan) cometh (on earth) not but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)

Satan fights to maintain control of the kingdoms of the world. He does not want them or your life to come under God's authority.

  

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (I John 1:8-9)

  

Despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and long suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? (Romans 2:4)

  

Rebuke can lead to repentance:

..If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. (Luke 17:3)

The Lord Of Hosts: In the Biblical record, these different names of God were used when requesting God to move in a specific way on behalf of His people. For example, the name Jehovah-Rapham meaning "the Lord that healeth," was used when seeking healing. The specific name of God which should be used in spiritual warfare is "Yahweh Sabbaoth" which is translated "the Lord of hosts" in the King James version of the Bible. When you call upon that name in warfare, the battle is the Lord's and all the hosts of Heaven come to your aid.

  

**Functions of Jesus in spiritual warfare:**

Authority over the forces of evil: The death of Jesus not only freed mankind from sin, but also resulted in triumph over the forces of evil. Because of this, you have authority over the enemy: Then He called His twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases. (Luke 9:1)

3. Destroying the works of the Devil:

...For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the Devil. (I John 3:8)

4. Intercession for believers: In Heaven Jesus is at the right hand of God the Father interceding for believers engaged in spiritual warfare. This means He is talking to the Father on your behalf:

...It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. (Romans 8:34)

  

**Names of Jesus**

The name "Jesus" means "Savior or deliverer" (Matthew 1:21). The name "Christ" means "the anointed one" (John 4:25- 26).

**Holy Spirit**

But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. (I Corinthians 2:10)

But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will. (I Corinthians 12:11)

Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.

After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit suffered them not. (Acts 16:6-7)

Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. (Acts 8:29)

Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me. (Romans 15:30)

Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (spoken). (Romans 8:26)

  

**Functions**

The Holy Spirit guides your warfare. He reveals spiritual things that cannot be known naturally. The Holy Spirit speaks the will and words of God to you. He also intercedes for you as you are engaged in spiritual battles.

  

Holy Spirit has feelings that can be affected by man’s actions:

the Bible warns that we should not lie to the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3-4), resist the Spirit (Acts 7:51), quench the Spirit (I Thessalonians 5:19), grieve the Spirit (Psalms 78:40 and Ephesians 4:30), insult the Spirit (Hebrews 6:4-6), blaspheme the Spirit (Matthew 12:31-32), or vex the Spirit (Isaiah 63:10).

Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe and tremble. (James 2:19)

The spiritual forces of evil believe in God and are fearful of Him, but they are still evil. To simply believe in God is not enough. You must acknowledge Him as Lord of your life. You must accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for your sin, repent, ask forgiveness, and become a new creature in Christ.

  
# Angels

The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them. (Psalms 34:7)

  

Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation. (Hebrews 1:14)

Angel means messenger 

  

For by Him were all things created, that are in Heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him and for Him. (Colossians 1:16)

  

**Cherubim**

“So He drove the man out; and at the east of the Garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.” (Genesis 3:24 NASB2020)

  

Exodus 25:18-22 God commanded cherubim statues creation to carry ark of covenant

  

Ezekiel 1:3-28

Ezekiel 10:22 4 wings, under wings juman hands, face of lion/ox/man/eagle

  

In Revelation 4:6? Guardians of God/highest order of angels?

  

**Seraphim**

“Seraphim were standing above Him, each having six wings: with two each covered his face, and with two each covered his feet, and with two each flew. And one called out to another and said, “Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of armies. The whole earth is full of His glory.”” (Isaiah 6:2-3 NASB2020)

Have (human?) hands & lead worship of God in heaven?

  

**Living Creatures**

“and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind. The first living creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.” And when the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and they will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying, “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.”” (Revelation 4:6-11 NASB2020)

  

“And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they *sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are You to take the scroll and to break its seals; for You were slaughtered, and You purchased people for God with Your blood from every tribe, language, people, and nation. You have made them into a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign upon the earth.”” (Revelation 5:6-10 NASB2020)

Manifest fullness of divine life & chief ministry = worship God?

  

**Michael**

Only Archangel mentioned

Daniel 10:13,21; 12:1; Jude 9; Revelation 12:7

“And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,”

(Revelation 12:7 NASB2020)

Has charge over an angel army

  

“But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was standing in my way for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.” (Daniel 10:13 NASB2020)

A Prince of Israel

Seven angels who administrate the seven last plagues: Revelation 15:1,7

Twenty-four elders (these may be angelic beings): Revelation 4 and 5 (I think they are ppl)

- Are reverent: Their highest activity is the worship of God. Nehemiah 9:6; Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 1:6

“I raised my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man dressed in linen, whose waist had a belt of pure gold of Uphaz. His body also was like topaz, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.”

(Daniel 10:5-6 NASB2020)

I believe this is a manifestation of God b/c he sounded like he had many voices and he was just a vision. He was bronze like Jesus. The angel that showed up later was of a different description, so this isn’t the angel most likely.

**Warnings**

Don’t worship angels:

“Take care that no one keeps defrauding you of your prize by delighting in humility and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,” (Colossians 2:18)

“I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things. And he *said to me, “Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”” (Revelation 22:8-9)

  

  

Reject angels preaching another gospel:

“But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!” (Galatians 1:8)

Some people have claimed to see angels who gave them a "new revelation" contrary to God's written Word. Entire religious movements have been founded on such false revelations. One of the main strategies of Satan is deception.

“No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.” (2 Corinthians 11:14)

  

Do not provoke the angels:

“‘Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them out.’ ” But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.” And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise and go with them; but you shall do only the thing that I tell you.” So Balaam arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the leaders of Moab. But God was angry that he was going, and the angel of the Lord took his stand in the road as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, the donkey turned off from the road and went into the field; and Balaam struck the donkey to guide her back onto the road. Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a stone wall on this side and on that side. When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she pressed herself against the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall, so he struck her again. Then the angel of the Lord went farther, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left. When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his staff. Then the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” And Balaam said to the donkey, “It is because you have made a mockery of me! If only there had been a sword in my hand! For I would have killed you by now!” But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing such a thing to you?” And he said, “No.” Then the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed all the way to the ground. Then the angel of the Lord said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way was reckless and contrary to me. But the donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away from me, I certainly would have killed you just now, and let her live.” So Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back.” But the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word that I tell you.” So Balaam went along with the representatives of Balak.” (Numbers 22:11-12, 20-35)

When you are disobedient to God, the angels may actually hinder you.

  

“Do not let your speech cause you to sin, and do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?” (Ecclesiastes 5:6) 

You will be fighting a battle, but it will not be warfare against the enemy. Be careful that you do not provoke the angels of God.

  

**Further Study**

References of sp. Actions of angels

  

Study the appearance of the angel in Judges 13. Note that the angel returns to Heaven through worship which apparently opens the way through the "Satanic atmosphere" around us to permit angels to operate on our behalf. Review the story of Daniel and note that the hindrance by the prince of Persia (a Satanic power) was broken by prayer and fasting.

  

There is no Biblical support that a believer can command his angel to do whatever he desires, but you can ask God to dispatch them in your behalf. Think about a battle you are facing and then ask God to send His "ministering spirits" to work in that situation.

  

Read Psalms 78:36,40 and Ecclesiastes 5:6. Israel had a special angel caring for them until they provoked him in the wilderness. If God sends an angel to your aid and you provoke him by sin and unbelief, he may depart from you. It is well to take heed to the warning in Exodus 23:20-22. You may also entertain an angel and not be aware of it...See Hebrews 13:2.

  
# Satan

“Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.” (1 Peter 5:8)

  

**God Created Evil**

“The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating disaster; I am the Lord who does all these things.” (Isaiah 45:7)

Did God create evil? Just like how darkness is the absence of light, evil is the absence of good. However God still created darkness, so he created evil. He created free will, so he created evil. This is because a person can choose to do good or bad. Why did God create evil? God knows that there has to be a counterparts for us not to function as robots. Why do we have to suffer to be strong? It makes the highs better. God knows the mysteries, don’t question him. He knows the evil plans, so he is in control of everything and you can trust him to guide you and protect you. He created evil by free will, but that does not mean that he is evil. He just made the balance of the world (or some other reason humans do not know of). God creates disasters to punish and to build.

Reddit:

“In another translation it says, I make peace and create calamity.

But this is a non issue for Calvinism.

God is all powerful and decrees everything. He is the Creator and does what He wants. He is sovereign.

Evil comes from sin and our own desires. God can either allow us to sin against Him or restrain our desires.

Sin still comes from evil desires of men's heart and not God. But does He allow it? Yes.

Because everything is done for His glory and for His purpose.

If we didn't know evil, we wouldn't know good. If we didn't know suffering we wouldn't understand peace. If we didn't understand hatefulness then we would never appreciate kindness. If we didn't understand wrath then we would never be grateful for salvation.

God uses ALL things for His glory and for His ultimate plan. The existence of evil is nothing more than the proof of our degeneracy. Humanity is fallen, with a depraved nature and it's only by the grace of God that we do any good at all.”

+ “calamity occurs when God withdraws his order”

+”God would not settle for goodness of a lesser degree”

+ “You're asking an age-old question known as "the problem of Evil."

In order to solve the problem you have to show that 1. God didn't make Evil, while 2. Keeping his Godly attributes of omnipotence, omnipresence, all-knowing, and all-good. Or alternatively, if Evil is a byproduct of some good or goods, you must then make an argument for why the goods are "worth it" to also introduce suffering in order to have them.

I've seen a number of arguments here influenced by Augustine, Aquinas, and Calvin. I recommend studying their arguments from the source.

Augustine came up with one of the most influential answers for this back in good old 400 AD. It is not meant as an unassailable logical bulwark, but people like to pretend.

He proposed the "free will defense" is lacking- humans are responsible for many evils in the world, but we don't create disease or natural disasters by an act of will.

He suggested that Evil was defined not as a thing of itself, but as a nothing- a "privation of Good". Similar to how a hole in the dirt is a privation of dirt.

Evil as the absence- or corruption- of good, means God did not make it- as it is not a thing- but that Evil arises from a good gone bad.

Is it wrong to desire money? No, you could do good things with money. But when the desire for money causes you to rob another person of their money, well that is a good thing gone bad.

But why is good able to go bad at all? Wouldn't it be better to have good things that can't go bad? Arguably it would be best to have good things that don't go bad- we are back at the free will argument.

If our will is corrupt (from the fall of man in Genesis) then it will draw us toward doing evil. We need a transformation of the will to put it right again- which is precisely what Augustine says God does for us through salvation.

Essentially, Augustine (believes in purgatory) argues that without suffering being possible, good things could not be as good as they are- and God would not settle for goodness of a lesser degree.”

  

**Former Position**

““Son of man, take up a song of mourning over the king of Tyre and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “You had the seal of perfection, Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. “You were in Eden, the garden of God; Every precious stone was your covering: The ruby, the topaz and the diamond; The beryl, the onyx and the jasper; The lapis lazuli, the turquoise and the emerald; And the gold, the workmanship of your settings and sockets, Was in you. On the day that you were created They were prepared. “You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire. “You were blameless in your ways From the day you were created Until unrighteousness was found in you. “By the abundance of your trade You were internally filled with violence, And you sinned; Therefore I have cast you as profane From the mountain of God. And I have destroyed you, you covering cherub, From the midst of the stones of fire. “Your heart was haughty because of your beauty; You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor. I threw you to the ground; I put you before kings, That they may see you. “By the multitude of your wrongdoings, In the unrighteousness of your trade You profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I have brought fire from the midst of you; It has consumed you, And I have turned you to ashes on the earth In the eyes of all who see you.” (Ezekiel 28:12-18)

  

“that you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say, “How the oppressor has ceased, And how the onslaught has ceased! “The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of rulers, Which used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing strokes, Which subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution. “The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; They break forth into shouts of joy. “Even the juniper trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, ‘Since you have been laid low, no tree cutter comes up against us.’ “Sheol below is excited about you, to meet you when you come; It stirs the spirits of the dead for you, all the leaders of the earth; It raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones. “They will all respond and say to you, ‘Even you have become weak as we, You have become like us. ‘Your pride and the music of your harps Have been brought down to Sheol; Maggots are spread out as your bed beneath you And worms are your covering.’ “How you have fallen from heaven, You star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who defeated the nations! “But you said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the recesses of the north. ‘I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.’ “Nevertheless you will be brought down to Sheol, To the recesses of the pit. “Those who see you will stare at you, They will closely examine you, saying, ‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms, Who made the world like a wilderness And overthrew its cities, Who did not allow his prisoners to go home?’ “All the kings of the nations lie in glory, Each in his own tomb. “But you have been hurled out of your tomb Like a rejected branch, Clothed with those killed who have been pierced with a sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit Like a trampled corpse. “You will not be united with them in burial, Because you have ruined your country, You have killed your people. May the descendants of evildoers never be mentioned. “Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons Because of the wrongdoing of their fathers. They must not arise and take possession of the earth, And fill the surface of the world with cities.” “I will rise up against them,” declares the Lord of armies, “and eliminate from Babylon name and survivors, offspring and descendants,” declares the Lord. “I will also make it the property of the hedgehog and swamps of water, and I will sweep it away with the broom of destruction,” declares the Lord of armies.” (Isaiah 14:4-23)

  

- Cherub who covers = guards
- Wise, holy, blameless, beautiful, perfect
- Worship Leader (on God’s holy mountain, model of perfection, the anointed cherub that covers = the guardian, highest action is worship of God since that is what we’ll do for eternity)

- https://community.logos.com/forums/t/197494.aspx
- https://carm.org/about-demons/was-lucifer-originally-an-angel-of-worship/
- https://www.compellingtruth.org/Satan-music.html
- Wanted to be worshipped instead of conducting worship
- The leader, but maybe a leader of worship, not the leader of worship

- Lucifer = light bearer
- Decked w/ precious stones set in gold (esv)

  

He is described as a gem of precious stones. But a gem has no light of its own. It is not beautiful in a dark room. Its beauty is in its ability to reflect light from without. When God created Lucifer, He made him with a capacity to reflect the glory of God to a greater degree than any other created being. God was the light that made Lucifer radiate beauty.

  

Isaiah 14:13-14

I will ascend to heaven = wants equal place in it as God

I will raise my throne above the stars of God = wants to occupy God’s abode & rule over the angelic hosts

I will sit upon the mount of assembly = Isaiah 2:2 & Psalms 48:1-2 say this is the center of God's earthly rule (wants to rule earth)

I will ascend above the heights of the clouds = Satan wants God's glory for himself. Exodus 13:21 (guidance); 40:34 (yes); 28 (only can find in 24); 34:5 (God in cloud); Job 37 (yes);15 (can’t find); 16 (can’t find); Matthew 26:64 (Jesus arrival); Revelation 14:14-16 (sit on it) say the clouds speak of God’s glory

I will make myself like the most high = summary

  

**Results of His Sin**

- Banished from heaven
- Corrupt
- Perverted pwr: used to destroy instead of glorifying God
- Destined 4 lake of fire
- Affected other angels
- Brought sin into world

  

**Where is he?**

“The Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the Lord and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”” (Job 1:7)

God uses many guardian angels b/c created beings are not omnipresent. Satan can only be in one place at once (even if that area is large or they move really fast like that angel that slaughtered hundreds in a night), even though angels are spiritual beings. This is why he uses demons to carry out his plans.

  

“Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.” (1 Peter 5:8)

  

**Activities**

“in which you previously walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:2)

Always directed against God, His plan, and His people. He will attack you in the areas of worship of God, the Word of God, your Christian walk, and your work for God.

  

**Qualities**

- Trickster through intelligence & subtlety:

- “But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his trickery, your minds will be led astray from sincere and pure devotion to Christ.” (2 Corinthians 11:3)

- Emotional: ex. Wrath

- “So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.” (Revelation 12:17)

- Self-willed

- “and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.” (2 Timothy 2:26)

- Powerful: Eph 2:2
- Deceitful 

- “Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.” (Ephesians 6:11)

- Fierce & Cruel: I Peter 5:8

- He says that pulling your hair out is worth it b/c he enjoys the cruelty of your anguish over it. Don’t listen to him and listen to God instead (who wants ur peace). Don’t be cruel to yourself.

- Deceptive (appearing as something he’s not)

- “No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.” (2 Corinthians 11:14)

Tempter: Matthew 4:3; I Thessalonians 3:5

Roaring Lion: I Peter 5:8

Ruler of darkness: Ephesians 6:12

You can recognize the power of Satan from his attributes and names. Because he is a deceptive, powerful enemy the Bible warns:

“Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (I Peter 5:8)

“Neither [Never] give place to the devil.” (Ephesians 4:27)

  

**Myths (Not Undefeatable)**

Not Omniscient (knowing all things): Would not have killed Jesus if he knew what would happen

  

Not Omnipotent (all powerful): Jesus said the power of God within you is greater than the power of Satan. For those who believe in Jesus, Satan is already a defeated foe (John 12:31). He is strong only to those who yield to him. His power is limited by the power of God (Job 1:10-12) and he is only able to overcome a believer as they yield control to him.

  

Not omnipresent (present everywhere): he dispatches a host of demons throughout the earth to do his will and accomplish his purposes

  

**Further Study**

His words (learn his strategies):

Genesis 3:1,4,5; Job 1:7-12; Job 2:1-6; Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13.

  

Satan is an exact opposite of the Holy Spirit. to Himself. Satan is committed to draw men

The Spirit was sent by God to draw men away from God.

In which areas is the enemy is active in your life?

Has he deceived you and lied to you? 

Has he subtly crept into your life to destroy and rob you of joy, peace, or your Christian testimony?

  

Comparison to natural (snake/serpent) ex.:

3 venir types: 

- Neurotorins: Affect nerves = courage
- Hemotorins: Affect blood = prevent the work of Jesus’s blood (salvation, healing, deliverance)
- Cardiotorins: Affect heart = attack your worship/service for God

  

Work by:

- Disguise: Difficult to see b/c look like the dirt/trees they’re in = disguise as angel of light
- Imitation: Protection. African tree viper "freezes" & sticks neck out like twig on tree = imitate things of God
- Inc size: Puff blows up big as possible for protection = large & threatening
- Scary sounds: hiss/rattle = to scare u away

  

Capture Food: 

- Strike: Swift & deadly attack.
- Constriction: Wraps itself around target & slowly squeezes out its life = cares of world, sinful weights, entanglements
- Throwing weight over prey to overcome it = terrorize you
- Bite & hold target in fangs while slow poison paralyzes target. (Snake's teeth sometimes broken off in struggle, but always grow back) = hold you in bondage while paralyzing you w/ his venom

Most dangerous part of snake = mouth. Shoots enough venom to paralyze, then devours prey

  

Snakes locate prey w/ dust on tongue to really info to brain. Stay still = it can’t find u. Satan spots u best when u run around in fear/confusion & stir up the dust. Stand against him dearly (dust is settled) & he can’t strike you. Bible: stand still, keep on standing, take courage, be anxious for nothing

  

When panic, snake shoots out all venom & is defenseless for while. Jesus used scripture against Satan’s attacks.

  

Avoid snake bite:

1. Recognize poisonous snakes (know your enemy)
2. Wear protective clothing (spiritual armor)
3. Avoid known snake territory (don’t go into areas of known temptation or Satanic activity)
4. Have a friend with you (importance of being part of the Body of Christ)
5. Avoid walking after dark/ darkened areas b/c snakes avoid direct sunlight. (no longer walk as children of the dark but as children of light!)
6. Don’t put hands/feet into places you can’t see (guard your fleshly senses, don’t be blind to God’s word & watch what u see, pay attention to what’s in mind/heart & purge the bad)
7. Don’t sit w/o looking around carefully (stationary targets are easier to hit than moving targets, be sure what ur doing/where you/who you’re w/ is right, prepare w/ Bible)
8. Don’t go out of your way to kill snake. 1000s bitten/ur b/c attempt w/o knowledge of their habits/habitats (We are to resist the Devil when we encounter him, not go looking for him, so flee temptations & don’t have them available [ex. Blocking when u can/need to] & know God’s word, & rely on God’s strength, not urs to overcome them/Satan)
9. Know what to do in case of snakebite (defensive warfare)

  

We have authority over serpents. Genesis 3, God pronounced a curse upon the serpent (Satan). He said that his head would be bruised by the seed of the woman (Jesus) and that the heel of the seed (Jesus) would be bruised by the serpent (from the pressure of Satan’s head on the cross)

  

Like severing head of natural snake, but it can still bite 4 hrs, heart still beats, still moves. 

Satan is still active in the world today and he still has power. But he has no authority. The only authority he has in your life is what you give him and the power and authority within you (Jesus) is greater than his pwr.

  
# Demons

“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,” (1 Timothy 4:1)

Lose salvation? Are they a false save (seed on and soil) or will they eventually return? Don’t worry about your salvation the Holy Spirit assured you you’re saved and nothing could ever separate you from God. So, they were false converts or they may return (no idea if this is scriptural).

  

You should not minimize the power of demon spirits in the world today, yet you must not become so preoccupied with them that you see a demon in everything that happens and in everyone around you. You should take a simple, literal, Biblical approach to the subject of demons. Do not study secular books about such powers of evil. Your only sources of study in these areas should be the Word of God or good Christian literature.

  

“for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him. (Colossians 1:16)

Even the evil principalities & dominions

  

“All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.” (John 1:3)

  

“And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, and they did not prevail, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.” (Revelation 12:7-9)

  

Confusión:

“For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, held for judgment;” (2 Peter 2:4)

  

“And angels who did not keep their own domain but abandoned their proper dwelling place, these He has kept in eternal restraints under darkness for the judgment of the great day,” (Jude 1:6)

  

““When the unclean spirit comes out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it then says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order. Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they come in and live there; and the last condition of that person becomes worse than the first.”” (Luke 11:24-26)

Demon is free to roam

  

“And Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion”; because many demons had entered him. And they were begging Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.” (Luke 8:30-31)

Some are not trapped in the abyss. Are all not trapped in the abyss? What is the abyss?

  

“Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key to the shaft of the abyss was given to him. He opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the shaft like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the shaft. Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a person. And in those days people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death will flee from them! The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like human faces. They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions. They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle. They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt people for five months. They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.” (Revelation 9:1-11)

Is the pit the same as the abyss? There was at least one angel in the abyss, so maybe the demons don’t want to go there because they personally know what it’s like and possessing someone keeps them out of it. Are the locusts demons?

  

Are all demons chained (metaphorically)? Are some demons physically chained in hell and cannot escape? Can they still influence us while they are there or do they have to be out of there to do so? The important thing is that the tormentors will come in the end times and that demons are harming us now.

  

https://mpoweredchristian.org/what-the-abyss-is-and-why-satan-and-the-demons-are-currently-in-it/ 

Idk if I agree

  

https://www.harvestbiblechurch.net/content.cfm?id=317&blog_id=1725

Are the sons of men in the book of job angels?

  

Conclusion:

I think some demons are stuck and some are free. Why would God chain up demons in the pit if they could still do what they normally do & influence/harm people. That must mean that there are some that free too. But does being free for them mean (not having a Phys body and needing to possess ppl/be in the air, do the demons have nowhere else to go when they are cast out so they have to possess something or go to the abyss)? What cause those sp. angels to be cast in the abyss?

  

““Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you accursed people, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;”

(Matthew 25:41)

Hell is their final destination

  

“And they cried out, saying, “What business do You have with us, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”” (Matthew 8:29)

The demons know that they will go to hell

  

**Active Areas**

Earth

Ephesians 2:2 powers of air

Colossians 1:13 powers of darkness

  

**Attributes**

Are spirits: Matthew 8:16; Luke 10:17, 20

Can appear visibly: Genesis 3:1 (Saran himself); Zechariah 3:1 (vision of Satan?); Matthew 4:9-10 (Jesus seeing Satan), Job 4:16 (Prob Satan b/c contradict salvation & says nobody cares if a man perished forever when God is deeply grieved, also specifies angels being found w/ error like him, https://theopolisinstitute.com/get-behind-me-eliphaz/) (If angels can be visible, I suppose demons can be vsisble as well if God allows it since I believe I saw one once); Matthew 12:43, 44 (are demons powerless w/o a body?, I don’t think so b/c of what I saw, also b/c phoenixurc link below); (I don’t think they can be in clearly human forms b/c even Satan appeared vague to Elisha’s & the one u saw is vague & all ppl are made in the image of God so it would be disrespectful to think a fellow human being was a demon b/c they can seem very bad if they are influenced by one, so just b/c someone is bad doesn’t mean they are a demon, even so the angels also looked different & more glowy than normal humans for a bit, but remember they can look like normal ppl b/c you should always be nice to someone b/c you might be entertaining an angel, why can’t demons look like normal ppl too, since it’s not clear in the Bible, just assume that ppl are just ppl unless you _know_ b/c you have discernment & they also have that strong creepy feeling & God will keep u safe, maybe they can’t look like clear ppl too b/c God put restrictions on them when they fell, for now I think they can only be blurry or non human looking irl, actually maybe I guess they probably can b/c Catholics believe it & you can discern anyways)

Can speak: Mark 5:9, 12; Luke 8:28; Matthew 8:31

Believe (that God is one & fear him [enouh to beg him not to torment them, but not enough not to be evil]): James 2:19

Exercise their wills: Luke 11:24; 8:32

Demonstrate intelligence: Mark 1:24

Have emotions: Luke 8:28; James 2:19

Have recognition: Acts 19:15

Have supernatural strength: Acts 19:16; Mark 5:3-4

Have supernatural presence: Daniel 9:21-23 (wrong ref b/c it is the angel Gabriel speaking, although this could happen during witchcraft)

Are eternal: Matthew 25:41

Have their own doctrine: I Timothy 4:1-3 (abstain from foods & forbid marriage)

Are evil: Matthew 10:1 (can be cast out); Mark 1:27 (called unclean); 3:11 (called unclean)

  

Note: When Saul had a séance performed to see Samuel, he did not see a demon, he saw the real Samuel:

[https://www.gotquestions.org/witch-of-endor.html](https://www.gotquestions.org/witch-of-endor.html)

https://thinkhardthinkwell.com/2024/01/18/did-the-medium-of-en-dor-really-see-samuels-spirit/ 

  

You have the pwr to determine if something is demonic or not just like Jesus did:

https://aandbcounseling.com/can-see-demons-like-jesus/ 

  

Can demons be seen?

“Certain scholars have even argued that God's curse on the fallen angels includes taking away their to manifest bodily, in the way good angels do throughout the Bible. I must admit, however, I don't know of any clear Scripture which confirms that theory. Moreover, if the demons were so anxious to escape their disembodied state, why did they immediately drive the pigs off a cliff? I think the legion might simply have been overcome with an insatiably desire to possess and harm God’s creatures, regardless of their ability to manifest corporeally.”

https://www.phoenixurc.org/pastors-study/2021/2/9/can-demons-appear-in-human-form-like-angels 

  

Can demons look like humans?

https://carm.org/carm/can-demons-appear-in-human-form/ 

https://www.neverthirsty.org/bible-qa/qa-archives/question/fallen-angels-look-human/

Bible doesn’t say yes or no & just b/c it’s not in the Bible doesn’t mean it’s not real (today’s tech). Ppl do séance and see ppl (demons) so I guess they can, if not to same degree as true angels (limited occurrences & ability to Phys. harm, choked Mami but only in dream, believers protected, remember the men who tried to cast out demons in Jesus name w/o being saved got beat up by the possessed ppl, not the demon itself). Even if they can harm me Phys., it will only be to the extent that God allows anyone to do so for his own good purposes & these are isolated incidents since chaos would occur if demons often take Phys form & possession wouldn’t make sense. A demon can look like a person in sp. circumstances, so don’t expect a random person on the street to be one (though they may have one). They have limited ability to harm you, as does everything else since God limits all (to protect us & to fulfill his plan).

  

**Structure of Forces**

Colossians 1:16 – God’s structure 

Ephesians 6:12 – Satan’s imitation

  

Principalities:

Jurisdictions w/ princes over them. This how Satan influences gov. Ex. Daniel 10:5, 12-13 Prince of Persia prevents angel from coming to Daniel earlier until Michael helped him

  

Powers & rulers of darkness of this world:

Social, political, and cultural systems 

  

Spiritual wickedness in high places:

High places = places of worship

  

Are United:

Luke 8:30 Legion & Mary Magdalene demons spoke in unison

“And if Satan is casting out Satan, he has become divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?” (Matthew 12:26)

  

Different Degrees of Wickedness:

““Now when the unclean spirit comes out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came’; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order. Then it goes and brings along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they come in and live there; and the last condition of that person becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation.”” (Matthew 12:43-45)

  

Can change their function:

“Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ And the Lord said to him, ‘How?’ And he said, ‘I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You shall entice him, and you will also prevail. Go and do so.’” (1 Kings 22:21-22)

“I will be…” -> not previously a lying spirit

  

Diff kinds (no clear divide):

1. Evil/unclean spirits: immoral acts, unclean thoughts, oppression, possession, disease/sickness, etc. 

1. afflict mind/nature of man
2. Matthew 10:1; 12:43; Mark 1:23-26

3. Spirit of infirmity: affect Phys. Body

1. Luke 13:11 (not sp. named)
2. Unclean spirit could do this

5. Seducing spirits: influence/seduce man to believe false doctrines & be damned to eternal punishment

1. Ex. Cults, false Christs/teachers
2. I Tim 4:11 (wrong ref)

# Enemy Territory

“Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.” (1 John 2:15-16)

  

Def of world:

- Gentiles
- Phys. Order of earth/Uni 
- Present condition of human affairs in opp. to God (system that runs the earth = extension of man’s flesh)

- group of flesh-centered individuals who make up the human race
- Flesh = basic evil human nature of man which is in willful rebellion against God
- provides an atmosphere, environment, and system which promotes fleshly sins. It surrounds man with that which appeals to his fleshly desires

  

**Prince of this world**

John 12:31

“I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in regard to Me, but so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me. Get up, let’s go from here.” (John 14:30-31)

  

God of this world:

“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4)

  

Kingdoms of world guided by Satanic philosophy and principles:

“Again, the devil *took Him along to a very high mountain and *showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him, “All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.”” (Matthew 4:8-9)

  

They will be God’s kingdoms soon:

“Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.”” (Revelation 11:15)

  

**Start of Sin**

Adam & Eve had dominion over the world: control, guide its systems & inhabitants according to God’s will. Lost dominion when they sinned.

  

When Jesus was crucified for the sins of all mankind and resurrected from the dead, He reclaimed the world. He pronounced judgment on the spiritual forces of evil:

“When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.” (Colossians 2:15)

  

Satan will not acknowledge the claims of Jesus over the kingdoms of the world until the final conflict.

  

**Structure of World**

Evil:

“who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,” (Galatians 1:4)

  

Without God:

“remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the people of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.” (Ephesians 2:12)

  

Deception to ensnare believers to become part of world system:

“For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward.” (2 John 1:7-8)

  

Judged & condemned by God:

“But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.” (1 Corinthians 11:32)

  

**Elements of the World**

= elementary principles of world & lead to spiritual bondage:

“So we too, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elementary principles of the world.” (Galatians 4:3)

  

Includes rudiments of world:

Regulations on which the world’s structure rests. Different from the principles of the Kingdom’s structure:

“See to it that there is no one who takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception in accordance with human tradition, in accordance with the elementary principles of the world, rather than in accordance with Christ. If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,” (Colossians 2:8, 20)

+ philosophy of the world: Principles of knowledge that aren’t based on Christ

  

**Spirit of the World**

Directly opposes Holy Spirit:

“Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God.” (1 Corinthians 2:12)

  

**Wisdom of World**

“For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written: “He is the one who catches the wise by their craftiness”;” (1 Corinthians 3:19)

He uses the wise’s their wisdom against them to catch them

  

**Course of World**

Cycle/routine/way it operates:

“in which you previously walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:2)

  

**Voices of World**

Contrary to God’s voice:

“We are destroying arguments and all arrogance raised against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians 10:5)

  

**Peace of World:**

Temporary, fragile, deceptive:

“Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (John 14:27)

  

**Sorrow of World**

“For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)

  

**Attitude of World**

Hates God:

“You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.” (James 4:4)

  

Hates believers:

““If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.” (John 15:18-19)

  

**Flesh**

1. Compulsive inner force which expresses itself in rebellion through sin
2. Body of man/beast

  

“For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. But if I do the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that dwells in me.” (Romans 7:18-20)

  

Everyone has it:

“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all mankind, because all sinned—” (Romans 5:12)

  

“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Romans 3:23)

  

**Lust of the Flesh**

“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16)

  

Lust = strong desire, soulish emotions, the natural tendency of man towards evil.

  

“Now these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.” (I Corinthians 10:6)

“Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they indeed craved them.” (1 Corinthians 10:6)

Lusting after evil things pleases your fleshly nature. Please God, not an evil force within you. It is how Satan attacks from within. The Spirit and the flesh war against each other in you.

  

How it develops:

Lust/sinful desire 1st enters through natural senses. The eye sees something evil or the ear hears something wicked. A touch, a taste, or even a smell can even foster lust. This is how Satan uses the environment of the world to tempt the flesh. The senses trigger an evil thought/desire in the mind. That lustful thought is what tempts you to do evil.

  

“No one is to say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.” (James 1:13-14)

  

“No temptation has overtaken you except something common to mankind; and God is faithful, so He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13)

  

Since the mind is used to tempt the flesh, Paul warns:

“For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans 8:6-8)

  

Results:

If you yield to lust, temptation results and if you yield to temptation, it results in sin which leads to death.

“Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death.” (James 1:15)

  

Made the world corrupt:

“Through these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world on account of lust.” (2 Peter 1:4)

  

Made flesh corrupt:

“that, in reference to your former way of life, you are to rid yourselves of the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,” (Ephesians 4:22)

  

Spirit & Flesh Relationship:

“For the desire of the flesh is against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, in order to keep you from doing whatever you want.” (Galatians 5:17)

  

“I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. For I joyfully agree with the law of God in the inner person, but I see a different law in the parts of my body waging war against the law of my mind, and making me a prisoner of the law of sin, the law which is in my body’s parts.” (Romans 7:21-23)

  

The lusts of the flesh, if not conquered, lead to sinful **works of the flesh** which result in spiritual death:

“Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: sexual immorality, impurity, indecent behavior, idolatry, witchcraft, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Galatians 5:19-21)

  

**4 types of Sin**

- Worship Sins: Idolatry, witchcraft
- Sexual Sins: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, & lasciviousness
- Personal Sins: Drunkenness & revellings
- Relationship Sins: Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, envyings, & murders

# Enemy Strategy

“Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. So resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brothers and sisters who are in the world.” (1 Peter 5:8-9)

  

**Enmity Against God**

Satan's original sin was that he wanted to be like God, so his present power and activities are directed primarily against God.  Satan's attack on the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, was really an attack on the character and control of God. Satan’s qualities are all opp. God’s

  

God = love, Satan = hatred & destruction

“Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. No one who has been born of God practices sin, because His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin continually, because he has been born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother and sister. For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we are to love one another; not as Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And for what reason did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil, but his brother’s were righteous. Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death. Everyone who hates his brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.” (1 John 3:7-15)

  

God creates life, Satan promotes death:

“Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, so that through death He might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,” (Hebrews 2:14)

  

Satan opposes God’s program:

Denies his existence:

“The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, they have committed detestable acts; There is no one who does good. The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of mankind To see if there are any who understand, Who seek God. They have all turned aside, together they are corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.” (Psalm 14:1-3)

  

Promotes lies:

“Then that lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will eliminate with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming; that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not accept the love of the truth so as to be saved. For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.” (2 Thessalonians 2:8-12)

  

**The Enemy & Nations**

God of this world (unbelievers & demonic forces):

“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4)

So you do have a God, even if you believe that you don’t follow one. You will always have a God, you just need to pick the right one. 

  

He offered the nations to Jesus during the temptation of Christ, and our Lord did not dispute the legitimacy of the offer. He simply refused to rebel against God in submitting to Satan's way of obtaining the rule (Matthew 4:8-10) (so he could have avoided the cup that caused him so much sorrow by ruling the nations Satan’s way).

  

During the tribulation period Satan will actually direct the affairs of a group of ten nations through the Antichrist (https://versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/when-will-the-10-kingdoms-of-revelation-arise)? After the second coming of Christ, Satan will be bound for a thousand years (Revelation 20:3). Upon his release, he will deceive the nations one last time to assemble them against Jerusalem and God (Revelation 20:7-10).

  

**The Enemy & Unbelievers**

His strategy is very powerful against unbelievers. unbelievers. He blinds their minds to the Gospel (II Corinthians 4:3-4) and snatches away the truth of the Gospel when they do hear it so that no response will occur (Luke 8:12). As a result, the Gospel sounds foolish and irrelevant to those who are lost in sin (I Corinthians 1:18).

  

Satan also snares many unbelievers in false religions (I Timothy 4:1-3) and leads them to walk according to the "course of the world" which is the philosophy of the age. That philosophy may vary from generation to generation and culture to culture, but it is always creature-centered and creature-promoting rather than God-centered. Satan is constantly sowing the seeds of rebellion (sin) in the hearts and minds of unbelievers.

  

One of the purposes of the Holy Spirit is to war against Satan for the souls of unbelievers. The Holy Spirit works to convict men and women of their sinful rebellion against God (John 16:7-11).

  

**Enmity Against Believers**

In the life of a believer Satan attacks:

  

The Word of God:

Satan will cause you to question the Word of God and will add to, take from, or distort the Scriptures. Remember that this happened in the very first temptation of Eve. This is why it is important for you to study and understand God's Word so you will not be deceived by these attacks.

  

Your Worship of God:

Satan's original rebellion involved his desire to be worshiped, so he especially targets the worship of believers. He will try to prevent you from worshiping or lead you into false or fleshly worship. Consequences are a hardened heart towards God & a sodden mindset towards your circumstances (since you are not being grateful to him).

  

Your Walk With God:

He accuses and slanders you, tempts you to engage in the works of the flesh, to be occupied with the world, and to rely upon your own human wisdom and strength. If He wins this territory he also wins…

  

Your Work for God:

He will try to deter you from accomplishing God's will by persecution, disaster, discouragement, prayerlessness, and busy involvement with the cares of the world. Satan also tries to affect your work for God by infiltrating the Church with false teachers and disciples (II Corinthians 11:13-15; II Peter 2:1-19; Matthew 13:38-39). While God sows good seed through your ministry, the enemy sows tares which are the "sons of the wicked one.” He promotes division within the Body of Christ trying to affect the work of God and His purposes in your life and ministry (when it is supposed to be completely unified, message driven in by Ephesians).

# God's Battle Plan
“The one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8)

Strategy based upon communication with our Commander-in-Chief by prayer, fasting, and the written Word of God. When you do not understand God's purpose and plan, you may be tempted to become discouraged in the conflicts of life. This is why many Christian soldiers fail in warfare: They do not understand the divine purpose behind the battle.

“And so in the present case, I say to you, stay away from these men and leave them alone, for if the source of this plan or movement is men, it will be overthrown; but if the source is God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.”” (Acts 5:38-39)
## Purpose of God
“Regarding His plan of the fullness of the times, to bring all things together in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth.” (Ephesians 1:10)

Satan battles to bring your heart, mind, spirit, and soul into allegiance to him instead of the Lord Jesus Christ.

“for it is God who is at work in you, both to desire and to work for His good pleasure.” (Philippians 2:13)

He works in you to accomplish his purpose 

“and do not go on presenting the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your body’s parts as instruments of righteousness for God.” (Romans 6:13)

Instrument = to bring your life and ministry in harmony with His purpose and plans. By doing this, you become a target for God's enemy, Satan.
## Purpose of Jesus
“the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8)

  

“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.” (John 10:10)

  

How he destroyed Stan’s works:

- He revealed the bondage of sin 

- “Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.” (John 8:34) So don’t make a “it will be ok” sin b/c it will bring you to slavery under sin & you will commit more, worse sins

- He forgave sins (Matthew 9:1-8; Mark 2:1-12,17; Luke 4:17-32).

- “And hearing this, Jesus *said to them, “It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”” (Mark 2:17)

- He stressed the heart condition rather than the deception of outward appearance (Matthew 15:16-20; Mark 7:20-23).

- “The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.” (Luke 6:45)
- “But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish; but your inside is full of greed and wickedness.” (Luke 11:39)

- He healed the sick (Matthew 11:5).
- He raised people from the dead (Mark 5:35-43; Luke 8:49-56; John 11)
- He released people from demonic powers (Matthew 8:16)

  

Jesus gave us the power to forgive sins:

“But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—then He *said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, pick up your stretcher and go home.” But when the crowds saw this, they were awestruck, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.” (Matthew 9:6, 8)

The wording: they glorified God b/c he gave the authority of forgiveness of sins & healing to man, not because God himself has the power to do so. Emphasize & show us that Jesus is to be our example and nothing he did is out of reach for us. We have the power to heal others and forgive sins through Christ who lives in us. Not that we should boast, but so that we should glorify since he is the source, the authority, and the generous giver of this power. We are grateful that he is including us as major 

instruments in his plan this way.

  

“If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.”” (John 20:23)

We have the pwr to forgive sins through Christ who is in us, just like how we can only heal if we have enough faith and if God approves of it (knows the person is unrepentant). We are not the source of the strength used to heal/forgive, but we are used as the medium for doing so. I do not understand why a medium for forgiveness is needed, but it is the same reason why a medium for healing is needed: to build faith w/ in-person acts. Google AI: While Jesus' followers have the authority to forgive sins in his name, only God can fully forgive sins.

He destroyed the works of Satan in the hearts, souls, minds, and bodies of humans:

“those who are blind receive sight and those who limp walk, those with leprosy are cleansed and those who are deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.” (Matthew 11:5)

  

Exposed Enemy Strategies:

- He taught on the deception of Satan which would increase during the last days on earth Matthew 24:3-28, 25 (continues his speech, but does not speak of an inc in evil); Mark 13:4-23; Luke 17:22-37; 21:8-36).
- He warned of Satan who was able to destroy the soul (Matthew 10:28).
- He spoke of the necessity of binding the strong man (Satan) before spoiling his goods (taking unbelievers from his kingdom and saving them so they can be a part of ours https://www.scottlapierre.org/jesus-will-bind-the-strong-man/#:~:text=The%20strong%20man%20is%20Satan,are%20part%20of%20his%20kingdom) (Matthew 12:26-30; Mark 3:23-27; Luke 11:17-24).
- He revealed how Satan tries to prevent the Word of God from being effective in the hearts of men and women (Matthew 13:38; Mark 4:15; Luke 8:12).
- He exposed those who were not right with God as being of their "father, the devil" (John 8:44-47).
- He revealed Satan as the "prince of the world" (John 14:30).

  

**Great Peace** 

Jesus came to give the peace of God & peace w/ God, but not w/ men/the world:

“Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.”” (John 14:27)

  

“And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:7)

  

**Great Division**

““Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I came to turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a person’s enemies will be the members of his household.” (Matthew 10:34-36)

  

Neutrality does not exist:

““No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.” (Matthew 6:24)

  

“The one who is not with Me is against Me; and the one who does not gather with Me scatters.” (Luke 11:23)

  

Jesus removed the veil between life and death. He warned of the deception of Satan's broad and easy path. He let men see the end result of choosing the wrong way:

““Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matthew 7:13-14)

  

““Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, enjoying himself in splendor every day. And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be fed from the scraps which fell from the rich man’s table; not only that, the dogs also were coming and licking his sores. Now it happened that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s arms; and the rich man also died and was buried. And in Hades he raised his eyes, being in torment, and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his arms. And he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.’ But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set, so that those who want to go over from here to you will not be able, nor will any people cross over from there to us.’ And he said, ‘Then I request of you, father, that you send him to my father’s house— for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so that they will not come to this place of torment as well.’ But Abraham *said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ But he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!’ But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.’ ”” (Luke 16:19-31)

  

Because He destroyed and exposed the works of Satan, Jesus was under assault throughout His earthly life. The enemy constantly tried to destroy Him or prevent Him from fulfilling the mission for which He had come. The moment He was born, an attempt was made on His life. During His public ministry there were several plots on His life and at least one attempt which was aborted. He met the opposition of demonic powers, religious leaders, His own followers, and Satan. When you align yourself with the plan and purposes of Jesus by accepting Him as your Savior, you become part of the army that wars against Satan & will face the attacks he used against the one.

### Word of God
Satan’s attack on Jesus: Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, Luke 4:1-13

Why turning stones into bread = sin: act independently of God & use pwr for personal benefit

Satan told Jesus to cast himself down from the temple top. Satan cannot cast you down, he asks/entices (not forces) you to do it yourself by your own lust. Common strat: Satan used (misapplied) scripture to back up his appeal.

1st two appeals Satan said: If you are the son of God do these things. If Jesus did it, he would have admitted that his son ship by God is inadequate. God had already spoken from Heaven confirming this relationship (Matthew 3:17). Satan always primarily attacks your relationship w/ God. Also, he makes it seem like you have to sin to verify your belief/identity, but he is doing the opposite (undermining them).

Other books are only useful if they are in harmony w/ God’s word. 

When you use scripture against Satan it must be w/in context or your doing the same thing as him and it is invalid.

“But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, since you do not understand the Scriptures nor the power of God.” (Matthew 22:29)

To know the word: study, meditate on, and memorize it
### Delegated Power & Authority over Satan
Power v. Authority

Ppl do not respect a policeman’s authority (pos. In gov) unless he has a weapon (his pwr)

“And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”” (Luke 24:49)

Power comes from Holy Spirit while authority comes from Jesus Christ & your pos. As believer

Pwr over enemy (Luke 9:1), extension of gospel (Acts 1:8), & Sin:

> “So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be to you; just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.”” (John 20:21-23)

Don’t worry about sin but have peace b/c God gave you pwr over it.

#### Kinds
> With every prayer and request, pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be alert with all perseverance and every request for all the saints, (Ephesians 6:18)
##### 3 lvls
> Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. (Matthew 7:7-8)

1. Ask: Simple
> 'You lust and do not have, so you commit murder. And you are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. ==You do not have because you do not ask==.' (James 4:2)
2. Seek: answers not immediate
>  'All these ==were continually devoting themselves with one mind to prayer==, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.' (Acts 1:14)
- Context: 
	- Before: Jesus told them they would soon receive Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5) & then ascended (Acts 1:9)
	- After: They recieved it (Acts 2:4)
> 'For David says of Him, ‘I saw the Lord continually before me, Because He is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken. ‘Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue was overjoyed; Moreover my flesh also will live in hope; For You will not abandon my soul to Hades, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay. ‘You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence.’ (Acts 2:25-28)
- David's inspiring words
> '“Brothers, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. So because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne, he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that He was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh suffer decay. It is this Jesus whom God raised up, a fact to which we are all witnesses. Therefore, since He has been exalted at the right hand of God, and has received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear. For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says: ‘The Lord said to my Lord , “Sit at My right hand, 'Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’ Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.” Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what are we to do?” Peter said to them, “Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.” And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on urging them, saying, "Be saved from this perverse generation!” So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls. (Acts 2:29-41)
- Having a soft heart (being receptive to the word) -> salvation from the perverse world
>Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles. And all the believers were together and had all things in common; and they would sell their property and possessions and share them with all, to the extent that anyone had need. They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.' (Acts 2:42-47)
- How wonderful it is to be saved
3. Knock: Persistence in (Luke 11:5-10)
> 'And he said to me, “Daniel, you who are treasured, understand the words that I am about to tell you and stand at your place, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling. Then he said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was standing in my way for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.' (Daniel 10:11-13)
- Daniel got an answer through his persistence, even though the devil delayed the answer to his prayer
